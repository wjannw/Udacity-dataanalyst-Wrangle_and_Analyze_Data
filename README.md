## Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Project Introduction
In this project, you'll gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.

## Project Motivation

* Context
Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

* Key Points
Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:

* You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.
* Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.
* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
* You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.

## Project Details
Your tasks in this project are as follows:

* Data wrangling, which consists of:
  * Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
  * Assessing data
  * Cleaning data
* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
* Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
